# WideVariant Philosophy and Organization

## Overview

This step gathers information across all samples at all candidate SNP positions. It takes the alignments of each sample to the reference genome[[1]](applewebdata://D1AD5627-4211-4792-892D-E20AE9883444#_ftn1) and outputs a table of candidate SNPs across all samples along with associated quality metrics. This process includes:

1.     Summarizing output alignment files into easily readable matlab tables;

2.     Making a list of candidate SNP positions; and

3.     Collecting and storing information from each candidate SNP position across all samples.
