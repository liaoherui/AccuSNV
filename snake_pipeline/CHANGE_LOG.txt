=====NAME, DATE=====

Add list of changes made for this version.

=========CHANGE LOG=========
=====Chris, 2023.06.21=====

Added hackathon config functionality and resolved issues with migration to engaging.


=========CHANGE LOG=========
=====Arolyn/Evan, 2022.10.31=====

Added -f flag to second rm in snake rule sam2bam_cleanup to avoid errors if files have already been cleaned up


=========CHANGE LOG=========
=====Arolyn, 2022.10.28=====

Removed old bowtie2_qc output from rule all (was left there by mistake when bowtie2_qc was modified to work with multiple reference genomes)


=========CHANGE LOG=========
=====AROLYN, 2022.10.27=====

Added comments to main files.

=====AROLYN, 2022.10.24=====

Fixed bug where statistics for indel_counter were not taken from the correct indices in diversity matrices (previously took indices 8+9; now takes indices 38+39). 

Also changed description of 40 statistics in header of pileup2diversity.py so that the indexing is python (0-based) indexing instead of matlab (1-based) indexing. Also made a small change to line 157 with Evan.

Bowtie2 QC script now works with multiple reference genomes. (I didn't test all possible use cases so lmk if there are issues. Also the script still has a lot of paths hard-coded and I didn't have time to fix all of it.)

I changed rule_all for the mapping step to have bam files instead of sam files. Since sam files are eventually deleted, the bam files are a better measure of whether or not the alignment already happened.

Approximately in order of importance:

Restored ability to generate coverage matrices (raw and normalized) as part of the candidate_mutation_table rule. Please see notes in Snakefile.py rule_all regarding how to turn this on. Also note that the flags -c (for a raw coverage matrix) and -n (for a normalized coverage matrix) in build_candidate_mutation_table.py have been updated to require output file paths not booleans.

Made sam2bam_cleanup rule higher priority than other rules (using snakemake's priority option). This cleans up sam files as quickly as possible to avoid a drain on space quotas from large sam files lurking around for longer than they need to.

Fixed bug in pileup2diversity.py so that it correctly handles cases where the reference genome has lowercase bases. Also modified the script to handle ambiguous bases in the reference genome.

Added a separate rule samtools_idx for samtools indexing of the reference genome. This was done to avoid re-indexing the reference genome, which wastes resources and likely causes a bug where pileup files have N's for all reference genome alleles.

Implemented shadow directories for sam2bam and mpileup2vcf rules. This avoids leaving behind temp files and truncated files when a job is aborted or a node stalls.

Implemented option to exclude nodes in json. Previously this was not fully implemented (exclude missing from list of parameters in snakemakeslurm.sh to pull from json).

Restored functionality of bowtie2 qc script. Previously the hard-coded directory structure did not match the directory structure used in GUS. Ideally in the future this script should take relevant directory structure as an input and not have anything hardcoded.

Moved output txt file from sam2bam_cleanup output to sam2bam_cleanup to 1-Mapping/bowtie2/ directory. This means that if you delete your logs folder, snakemake won't force you to re-do alignments in order to re-produce the cleanup confirmation.

Merged string_outgroup_bool rule into candidate_mutation_table_prep (no need for rules to be separated).

Ensured consistent usage of pre-defined directories (like the reference genome directory) and removed cases of hard-coding.

Fixed bug relating to leftover ancient flags in vcf2quals and pileup2diversity_matrix (these were accidentally introduced while testing code).

Fixed bug in bracken rule input (input called kraken_report was incorrectly referred to later on as only report).
